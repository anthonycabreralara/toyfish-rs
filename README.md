# 🐟 Toyfish (Rust Edition)

A Rust implementation of the [Toyfish](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/toyfish) chess engine — a minimal, educational chess engine designed for simplicity and clarity. This project aims to bring Toyfish to Rust with a clean architecture and modern Rust best practices.

## 📌 About

Toyfish is a small chess engine originally written in Python. This Rust port is primarily for educational purposes, ideal for learning how chess engines work under the hood: move generation, evaluation, and search.

This project is **not meant to be competitive** with modern engines like Stockfish, but it will help you understand the building blocks of a functioning chess engine.
